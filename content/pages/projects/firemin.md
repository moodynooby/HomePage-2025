Have you ever felt that it seems all the browsers seems to converging into a one UI , a soul-less and homogenus mess.... well thats called [Carcinisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation) but every one in a while a lobster comes around which strays from the crab pathway

Hence this was a concept browser aiming to make it more fun and streamlined , it is done via adding of small changes like icons in menus , thoughfull animations , less distrations etc
Check it out!!
